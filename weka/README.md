# Weka

Weka is a machine learning graphical toolkit that's written in Java.  The application is quite amazing and can be used 
to test various Machine Learning algorithms against data before formally writing any code. 

You can read more about it on: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weka_(machine_learning)), and you can also [Download it](https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/downloading_weka/)

The files in this directly contain:

- auto-weka.cfg - A configuration file for running various classification algorithms against the test data and guessing which algorithm is best
- auto-weka model test.txt - The output of an hour long test on my machine.
- various screenshots for my presentation.
