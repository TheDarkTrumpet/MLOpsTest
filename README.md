# mlOpsTest

## Purpose
This repository is intended as a test of various MLOps frameworks, scripts, and potential workflows.
and there's a lot that will come out in this for articles.  Please see
the articles section here for those, as they're developed.

The base language for this is Python, and largely speaking little of this would be useful OOTB for 
most people.  Instead, this is references that will appear in my blog articles and potential presentations
on the topic.

## Frameworks Tested

- BentoML
- MLFlow

## References/Articles

- TBD.
